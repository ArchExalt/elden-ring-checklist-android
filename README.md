This Android app was created in order to bring the ease of use in form of a minimalistic checklist for Elden Ring players. Updated to version 1.12.3.

Functionality:
- check off obtained items, finished quests, completed achievements and more for both Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree;
- easily navigate through the list of items in alphabetical order;
- monitor your completion progress;
- switch between light/dark theme;
- use the app in offline mode, no Internet connection required.

If you have any questions, would like to contribute to the app, or want to report a bug, feel free to open an issue on GitHub or contact me via archexalt@proton.me.
